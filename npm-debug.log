jitsu\n*Flawless command line deployment of Node.js apps to the cloud*\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/raw/master/assets/jitsu.png\"/>\n\n## Overview\n\n[Jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu) is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for managing and deploying Node.js applications. It's open-source and easy to use. [We've](http://github.com/nodejitsu) designed `jitsu` to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.\n\n`jitsu` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).\n\n## One-line npm install\n\n    [sudo] curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\n\n## One-line jitsu install\n\n    [sudo] npm install jitsu -g\n\n## Features\n\n`jitsu` is built on some amazing technologies which we've been actively building with the community since 2009. `jitsu` is fully extendable and extremely modular ( see [Libaries](#Libraries) section ).\n\n - Allows for seamless deployment of your Node.js applications to the cloud\n - Ships with use-full boilerplates and sample applications through [Node Apps](http://github.com/nodeapps/) project integration\n - Fully supports `npm` dependency resolution on deployment to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)\n - Full support of [Nodejitu's API](http://github.com/nodejitsu/nodejitsu-api) ( a plethora of node.js goodies )\n - Integrated multi-level multi-transport logging support via [Winston](http://github.com/indexzero/winston/)\n - Too many to list... seek [further knowledge ](http://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook) or just try it out!\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Installation\n\n*( inside an empty directory )*\n\n     jitsu install\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Deployment\n\n*( inside the path of your Node.js application )*\n\n     jitsu deploy\n\n\nThis will create a new application, package.json, and deploy your path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). If it's your first deployment, you'll be prompted for some information such as *subdomain* and *start script* but it's really easy and we promise it will only take a few seconds.\n\nIf you have any issues deploying your node.js application please feel free to open up an issue on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/issues) section of this page, we'll have someone get back to you in a flash!\n\n## Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self documenting. After installation, run the `jitsu` command from your command line.\n\nIf it's your first time using `jitsu`, you will be prompted to login with an existing account or create a new account.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/raw/master/assets/login.png\"/>\n\n## After you've logged in, you can start deploying apps immediately!\n\n\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self-documenting. Try any of these commands to get started.\n\n\n   **Usage:**\n   \n     jitsu <resource> <action> <param1> <param2> ...\n   \n   **Common Commands:**\n\n   *To install a pre-built application*\n\n     jitsu install\n\n   *To sign up for [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)*\n\n     jitsu signup\n\n   *To log into [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)*\n\n     jitsu login\n\n   *Deploys current path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)*\n   \n     jitsu deploy\n   \n   *Creates a new application on [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)*\n   \n     jitsu create\n   \n   *Lists all applications for the current user*\n   \n     jitsu list\n   \n   *Additional Commands*\n   \n     jitsu apps\n     jitsu snapshots\n     jitsu users\n     jitsu logs\n     jitsu databases\n     jitsu conf\n     jitsu logout\n\n\n\n### Help\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self documenting. We suggest just trying it out. All commands will yield friendly messages if you specify incorrect parameters. If you find anything difficult to use, please open up a [Github issue](https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/issues) or pull request! \n\n     jitsu help\n     jitsu help apps\n     jitsu help snapshots\n     jitsu help users\n     jitsu help logs\n     jitsu help databases\n     jitsu help config\n\n## .jitsuconf file\n\nAll configuration data for your local `jitsu` install is located in the *.jitsuconf* file in your home directory. Directly modifying this file is not really advised. You should be able to make all configuration changes via:\n\n    jitsu config\n\nIf you need to have multiple configuration files, use --localconf or --jitsuconf options.\n\n##jitsu options\n\n    jitsu [commands] [options]\n \n    --version             print jitsu version and exit\n    --localconf           search for .jitsuconf file in ./ and then parent directories\n    --jitsuconf [file]    specify file to load configuration from\n    --noanalyze           skip require-analyzer: do not attempt to dynamicially detect dependencies\n\n##jitsu behind proxy\n\nIf you are behind a proxy and you haven't configured jitsu to use it, `jitsu` will throw an error, `Jitsu requires you to connect to Nodejitsu's stack (api.nodejitsu.com)`.\nIn order to solve this issue, you can configure jitsu to use a proxy by executing the following command.\n\n    jitsu config set proxy http://proxy.domain.com:3128/\n\nIf you need to authenticate yourselves to the proxy, you can try this command.\n\n    jitsu config set proxy http://user:pass@proxy.domain.com:3128/\n\n<a name=\"Libraries\"></a>\n## Libraries\n`jitsu` is built on a few well developed, well maintained Node.js libraries. The [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com) team and friends have been building and using these projects actively for the past two years. They are the most used Node libraries (see: [http://search.npmjs.org/](http://search.npmjs.org/)) and are actively maintained by Nodejitsu and other core members of the Node.js community. Each library serves a specific function and we highly suggest you check each one out individually if you wish to increase your knowledge of Node.js\n\n- [npm](http://npmjs.org) - Node Package Manager\n- [colors](http://github.com/marak/colors) - Terminal Colors module\n- [optimist](http://github.com/substack/optimist) - CLI Options Parsing\n- [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) - http request module\n- [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) - Asynchronous Iteration\n- [vows](http://vowsjs.org) - Asynchronous BDD testing library\n- [winston](http://github.com/indexzero/winston/) - Multi-transport logging library\n\n### Need more?\nThe documentation for `jitsu` and the [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com) APIs is open-source and a work in-progress.

It's open-source and easy to use. [We've](https://github.com/nodejitsu) designed `jitsu` to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.\n\n`jitsu` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).\n\n## One-line npm install\n\n    [sudo] curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\n\n## One-line jitsu install\n\n    [sudo] npm install jitsu -g\n\n## Features\n\n`jitsu` is built on some amazing technologies which we've been actively building with the community since 2009. `jitsu` is fully extendable and extremely modular ( see [Libaries](#Libraries) section ).\n\n - Allows for seamless deployment of your Node.js applications to the cloud\n - Ships with use-full boilerplates and sample applications through [Node Apps](https://github.com/nodeapps) project integration\n - Fully supports `npm` dependency resolution on deployment to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)\n - Full support of [Nodejitu's API](https://github.com/nodejitsu/nodejitsu-api) ( a plethora of node.js goodies )\n - Integrated multi-level multi-transport logging support via [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston)\n - Too many to list... seek [further knowledge ](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook) or just try it out!\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Installation\n\n*( inside an empty directory )*\n\n     jitsu install\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Deployment\n\n*( inside the path of your Node.js application )*\n\n     jitsu deploy\n\n\nThis will create a new application, package.json, and deploy your path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). If it's your first deployment, you'll be prompted for some information such as *subdomain* and *start script* but it's really easy and we promise it will only take a few seconds.\n\nIf you have any issues deploying your node.js application please feel free to open up an issue on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/issues) section of this page, we'll have someone get back to you in a flash!\n\n## Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self documenting. After installation, run the `jitsu` command from your command line.\n\nIf it's your first time using `jitsu`, you will be prompted to login with an existing account or create a new account.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/raw/master/assets/login.png\"/>\n\n## After you've logged in, you can start deploying apps immediately!\n\n\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self-documenting.

Overview\n\n[Jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu) is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for managing and deploying Node.js applications. It's open-source and easy to use. [We've](http://github.com/nodejitsu) designed `jitsu` to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.\n\n`jitsu` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).\n\n## One-line npm install\n\n    [sudo] curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\n\n## One-line jitsu install\n\n    [sudo] npm install jitsu -g\n\n## Features\n\n`jitsu` is built on some amazing technologies which we've been actively building with the community since 2009. `jitsu` is fully extendable and extremely modular ( see [Libaries](#Libraries) section ).\n\n - Allows for seamless deployment of your Node.js applications to the cloud\n - Ships with use-full boilerplates and sample applications through [Node Apps](http://github.com/nodeapps/) project integration\n - Fully supports `npm` dependency resolution on deployment to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)\n - Full support of [Nodejitu's API](http://github.com/nodejitsu/nodejitsu-api) ( a plethora of node.js goodies )\n - Integrated multi-level multi-transport logging support via [Winston](http://github.com/indexzero/winston/)\n - Too many to list... seek [further knowledge ](http://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook) or just try it out!\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Installation\n\n*( inside an empty directory )*\n\n     jitsu install\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Deployment\n\n*( inside the path of your Node.js application )*\n\n     jitsu deploy\n\n\nThis will create a new application, package.json, and deploy your path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). If it's your first deployment, you'll be prompted for some information such as *subdomain* and *start script* but it's really easy and we promise it will only take a few seconds.\n\nIf you have any issues deploying your node.js application please feel free to open up an issue on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/issues) section of this page, we'll have someone get back to you in a flash!\n\n## Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self documenting. After installation, run the `jitsu` command from your command line.\n\nIf it's your first time using `jitsu`, you will be prompted to login with an existing account or create a new account.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/raw/master/assets/login.png\"/>\n\n## After you've logged in, you can start deploying apps immediately!\n\n\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mostly self-documenting.

[We've](https://github.com/nodejitsu) designed `jitsu` to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.\n\n`jitsu` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).\n\n## One-line npm install\n\n    [sudo] curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\n\n## One-line jitsu install\n\n    [sudo] npm install jitsu -g\n\n## Features\n\n`jitsu` is built on some amazing technologies which we've been actively building with the community since 2009. `jitsu` is fully extendable and extremely modular ( see [Libraries](#Libraries) section ).\n\n - Allows for seamless deployment of your Node.js applications to the cloud\n - Ships with use-full boilerplates and sample applications through [Node Apps](https://github.com/nodeapps) project integration\n - Fully supports `npm` dependency resolution on deployment to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com)\n - Full support of [Nodejitu's API](https://github.com/nodejitsu/nodejitsu-api) ( a plethora of node.js goodies )\n - Integrated multi-level multi-transport logging support via [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston)\n - Too many to list... seek [further knowledge ](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook) or just try it out!\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Installation\n\n*( inside an empty directory )*\n\n     jitsu install\n\n\n# One-Line Node App Deployment\n\n*( inside the path of your Node.js application )*\n\n     jitsu deploy\n\n\nThis will create a new application, package.json, and deploy your path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). If it's your first deployment, you'll be prompted for some information such as *subdomain* and *start script* but it's really easy and we promise it will only take a few seconds.\n\nIf you have any issues deploying your node.js application please feel free to open up an issue on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/issues) section of this page, we'll have someone get back to you in a flash!\n\n## Usage\n\n`jitsu` is mos
